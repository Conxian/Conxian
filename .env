# Conxian Environment Configuration (Authoritative)
# This .env is the single source of truth for addresses and keys.
# Per Hiro docs: testnet Stacks addresses start with 'ST', mainnet with 'SP'.

# ===== Core Network & API =====

STACKS_API_BASE=https://api.testnet.hiro.so
NETWORK=testnet

# ===== Authoritative Testnet Deployer =====
# This is the deployer address we will enforce across configs.
# It must be a testnet address (prefix ST) per Hiro docs.
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=ST3PPMPR7SAY4CAKQ4ZMYC2Q9FAVBE813YWNJ4JE6

# Private key used for deployments and transaction broadcasting
# (referenced by Testnet.toml as ${STACKS_DEPLOYER_PRIVKEY})

# If you deploy via mnemonic, set it here (referenced by Testnet.toml)

# Keeper / SDK broadcast key (kept in sync with deployer unless you separate roles)

# ===== System Account (optional) =====
# Align to testnet. By default we point to the same deployer address.
# If you need a separate system account, replace the values below.

# ===== Security Guidelines =====
# 1. NEVER commit real values to version control for production.
# 2. Back up this file securely (encrypted storage or password manager).
# 3. Prefer hardware wallets for production deployments.
# 4. Rotate keys after any suspected compromise.
# 5. Ensure NETWORK and address prefixes match (testnet => ST, mainnet => SP).
