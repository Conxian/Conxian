## 4. EPOCH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### 4.1 Epoch Structure

**Epoch Duration:** 30 days (518,400 blocks at 5s/block)

**Epoch Phases:**

1. **Accumulation Phase** (Days 1-28): Points earned
2. **Calculation Phase** (Days 29-30): Off-chain calculation
3. **Claim Phase** (Days 31-60): 30-day claim window
4. **Auto-Conversion** (Day 61): Keeper executes unclaimed

### 4.2 Epoch Transitions

**Automated Tasks:**

```clarity
// automation-keeper.clar
(define-public (execute-epoch-transition (epoch-id uint))
  (begin
    ;; 1. Finalize previous epoch
    (try! (contract-call? .points-oracle finalize-epoch (- epoch-id u1)))
    
    ;; 2. Calculate conversion rates
    (try! (calculate-conversion-rates epoch-id))
    
    ;; 3. Open claim window
    (try! (contract-call? .gamification-manager open-claim-window epoch-id))
    
    ;; 4. Start new epoch
    (try! (contract-call? .points-oracle start-epoch epoch-id))
    
    (ok true)
  )
)
```

**Manual Oversight:**

- Founder reviews epoch calculations (Epochs 1-4)
- DAO reviews epoch calculations (Epochs 5+)
- Emergency pause available if issues detected

### 4.3 Points Calculation Process

**Off-Chain Service:**

```typescript
// points-calculator.ts
async function calculateEpochPoints(epochId: number) {
  // 1. Fetch all on-chain events
  const events = await fetchEpochEvents(epochId);
  
  // 2. Calculate points per user
  const userPoints = calculateUserPoints(events);
  
  // 3. Apply behavior multipliers
  const adjustedPoints = applyMultipliers(userPoints);
  
  // 4. Generate Merkle tree
  const merkleTree = generateMerkleTree(adjustedPoints);
  
  // 5. Submit root (3-of-5 multisig)
  await submitMerkleRoot(merkleTree.root, epochId);
  
  return merkleTree;
}
```

**Attestor Network:**

- 5 independent nodes (geographic distribution)
- 3-of-5 threshold for Merkle root submission
- Slashing for malicious behavior
- Rewards for honest participation
