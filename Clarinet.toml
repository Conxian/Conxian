# Conxian Clarinet manifest
# Policy highlights:
# - Centralized traits: import/implement via .all-traits.*
# - addresses must match the [contracts.<key>] name
# - depends_on uses contract keys, e.g., ["all-traits", ...]
# - Avoid duplicate [contracts.*] tables; keep a single registration per contract
