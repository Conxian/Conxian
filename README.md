# Conxian Protocol

## Overview

The Conxian Protocol is a comprehensive, multi-dimensional DeFi protocol built on the Stacks blockchain. It features a modular, decentralized architecture designed for security, scalability, and enterprise adoption. The protocol is currently under active development and is in a stabilization phase.

## Current Status: Under Review

The Conxian Protocol is currently undergoing a comprehensive review to ensure the correctness, security, and alignment of all contracts and documentation. The codebase is not yet production-ready, and some features are still under development.

**WARNING: Do not attempt to deploy to Mainnet.**

## Contract Modules

The Conxian Protocol is organized into a series of specialized modules:

- **[Core Module](./contracts/core/README.md)**: The foundational layer of the protocol, responsible for orchestrating interactions between various components.
- **[DEX Module](./contracts/dex/README.md)**: Provides the core functionality for decentralized exchange operations.
- **[Governance Module](./contracts/governance/README.md)**: A comprehensive framework for decentralized decision-making and protocol upgrades, including the Conxian Operations Engine (an automated Operations & Resilience governance seat) and council/role NFTs.
- **[Lending Module](./contracts/lending/README.md)**: The core infrastructure for decentralized lending and borrowing.
- **[Tokens Module](./contracts/tokens/README.md)**: Provides the core token functionality for the protocol.
- **[Security Module](./contracts/security/README.md)**: MEV protection, circuit breakers, access control, and other security primitives.
- **[Monitoring Module](./contracts/monitoring/README.md)**: Observability, analytics, and dashboard infrastructure for protocol metrics.
