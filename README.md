# Conxian Protocol

## Overview

The Conxian Protocol is a comprehensive, multi-dimensional DeFi protocol built on the Stacks blockchain. It features a modular, decentralized architecture designed for security, scalability, and enterprise adoption. The protocol is currently under active development and is in a stabilization phase.

## Current Status: Under Review

The Conxian Protocol is currently undergoing a comprehensive review to ensure the correctness, security, and alignment of all contracts and documentation. The codebase is not yet production-ready, and some features are still under development.

**WARNING: Do not attempt to deploy to Mainnet.**

## Contract Modules

The Conxian Protocol is organized into a series of specialized modules:

- **[Core Module](./contracts/core/README.md)**: The foundational layer of the protocol, responsible for orchestrating interactions between various components.
- **[DEX Module](./contracts/dex/README.md)**: Provides the core functionality for decentralized exchange operations.
- **[Governance Module](./contracts/governance/README.md)**: A comprehensive framework for decentralized decision-making and protocol upgrades.
- **[Lending Module](./contracts/lending/README.md)**: The core infrastructure for decentralized lending and borrowing.
- **[Tokens Module](./contracts/tokens/README.md)**: Provides the core token functionality for the protocol.

## Documentation

- **[Whitepaper](./documentation/whitepaper/Conxian-Whitepaper.md)**: The full technical vision and architecture of the protocol.
- **[Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)**: The development phases and status tracking for the project.
