# Tokens Module

This module contains the various SIP-010 fungible tokens used throughout the Conxian Protocol.

## Status

**Under Review**: The token contracts are functional and adhere to the SIP-010 standard. However, they are part of the protocol-wide stabilization and safety review.

## Core Protocol Tokens

This module defines several distinct tokens, each with a specific purpose within the Conxian ecosystem.

- **`cxd-token.clar`**: The primary governance and utility token of the Conxian Protocol.

- **`cxlp-token.clar`**: A liquidity provider (LP) token, representing a user's share in a DEX liquidity pool.

- **`cxs-token.clar`**: A token intended for use in stability mechanisms within the protocol.

- **`cxtr-token.clar`**: A treasury reserve token, likely for protocol development and operational funding.

- **`cxvg-token.clar`**: A governance utility token, potentially for vesting or other specialized governance functions.

All tokens in this module implement the SIP-010 standard for fungible tokens, ensuring compatibility with the broader Stacks ecosystem.
