# Vaults Module

This module contains the contracts for managing asset vaults within the Conxian Protocol, with a primary focus on the sBTC vault.

## Status

**Under Review**: The vault contracts provide a foundational layer for asset management, but are currently part of the protocol-wide stabilization and safety review.

## Core Components

The central feature of this module is the `sbtc-vault`, which allows users to deposit their sBTC to earn yield.

### Key Contracts

- **`sbtc-vault.clar`**: The main contract for the sBTC vault. It handles user deposits and withdrawals of sBTC. It is intended to integrate with various yield-generating strategies.

- **`custody.clar`**: A contract designed to manage the custody of assets deposited into the vaults, separating the core logic from the direct handling of funds.

- **`yield-aggregator.clar`**: A contract intended to aggregate yield from multiple sources or strategies, although the specific strategies are not yet fully implemented.

- **`fee-manager.clar`**: Manages the collection and distribution of fees generated by the vault's activities.

- **`vault-registrar.clar`**: A registry for all vaults within the protocol, allowing for discovery and management.
