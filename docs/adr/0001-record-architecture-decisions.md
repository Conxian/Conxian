# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to ensure consistency and provide context for future development.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important architectural decisions following the format described by Michael Nygard in his article on "Documenting Architecture Decisions".

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- Better documentation of architectural decisions
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Clear rationale for why certain approaches were taken
- Easier to revisit and potentially reverse decisions in the future
