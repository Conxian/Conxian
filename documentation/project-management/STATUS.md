*Last Updated: November 12, 2025*

## Current Phase

**Phase 2: Token Economics & Cross-Chain Integration** (Weeks 3-4)

## Active Workstreams

- [x] Standardize trait imports across all contracts (COMPLETED)
- [x] Implement core conxian-protocol.clar (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create circuit breaker contract (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Token emission controller enhancements
- [ ] Wormhole message validation implementation
- [ ] Cross-chain asset transfer completion

## Recent Milestones

- [x] Phase 1 Foundation completed (239+ contracts, trait standardization)
- [x] Documentation overhaul completed (comprehensive user guides)
- [x] Enterprise integration framework established
- [x] Security infrastructure implemented (circuit breakers, MEV protection)
- [x] Cross-chain sBTC integration completed

## Known Issues

- Some contract READMEs reference non-existent contracts
- Documentation misalignments with actual implementation
- Incomplete test coverage for newer contracts

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 2 token economics implementation
2. Finalize cross-chain integrations
3. Update contract documentation accuracy
4. Enhance test coverage to 80%+
