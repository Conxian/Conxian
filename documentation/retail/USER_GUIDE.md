### 2. Add Some Crypto

You'll need two types of crypto:

- **STX** - For paying small fees (like transaction costs at a store)
- **Trading crypto** - What you want to trade or save

The trading feature lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another instantly.

│ Buy: [0.0025] sBTC ≈ $25.00         │
│ Fee: 0.30 STX                       │
│ [Swap Now]                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 4: Earn Interest (Yield Vaults)

Yield vaults are like high-interest savings accounts for crypto. Deposit your crypto and earn interest automatically.

**How it works:**

1. **Find a vault** for your crypto (STX, sBTC, etc.)
2. **Deposit crypto** - Send your crypto to the vault
3. **Get "shares"** - Receive vault shares representing your deposit
4. **Earn interest** - Your shares grow in value over time
5. **Withdraw anytime** - Get your crypto back plus earned interest

**Current Rates (Example):**

- STX Vault: 8.5% APY
- sBTC Vault: 6.2% APY
- Other tokens: 4-12% APY

**Visual Guide:**

```
[Image: Vault deposit screen]
Your Deposit: 100 STX
Shares Received: 98.7 (after 1.3 fee)
Current APY: 8.5%
Estimated Monthly Earnings: ~0.71 STX
```

## Core Features Explained

### 💰 Earn Passive Income

**How it works:**

```
Deposit → Receive Shares → Earn Daily → Withdraw Anytime
```

**Benefits:**

- **No minimum deposit** - Start with any amount
- **Automatic earnings** - No manual work needed
- **Flexible withdrawals** - Access your money anytime
- **Compound growth** - Earnings on your earnings

**Current Fees:**

### 🗳️ Governance & Voting

**What it is:**
Conxian is owned by its users. You can vote on important decisions.

**How to participate:**

1. **Get CXVG tokens** (governance tokens)
2. **Join discussions** on community forums
3. **Vote on proposals** - Changes to fees, new features, etc.
4. **Share in rewards** - 80% of platform fees go to CXVG holders

**Why it matters:**

- Your voice shapes the platform
- Earn extra income from governance
- Help build the future of crypto

### 💱 Advanced Trading

**Multi-Hop Trading:**
Instead of direct trades, Conxian finds the best path through multiple pools for better rates.

**Example:**

```
You want: STX → sBTC
Best path: STX → USDA → sBTC
Result: 2% better rate!
```

**Liquidity Pools:**

- Provide crypto to pools = Earn trading fees
- More you provide = More you earn
- Can withdraw anytime

**Visual Guide:**

```
[Image: Multi-hop trading visualization]
STX → [Pool A] → USDA → [Pool B] → sBTC
Rate: 2% better than direct trade
```
