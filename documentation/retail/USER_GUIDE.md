# Welcome to Conxian: A Guide for Retail Users

This guide is designed to help you get started with the Conxian protocol. We'll walk you through the essential steps to begin using the platform's core features for swapping tokens and earning yield.

## What is Conxian?

Conxian is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Stacks blockchain, which is secured by Bitcoin. It allows you to trade cryptocurrencies and earn interest on your holdings in a permissionless and secure way. For retail users, the two most important features are:

*   **The DEX (Decentralized Exchange):** Swap one cryptocurrency for another.
*   **Yield Vaults:** Deposit your crypto to earn yield automatically.

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Setup Wallet

- Install [Hiro Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) (recommended)
- Fund with STX for transaction fees
- Get supported tokens (STX, sBTC)

### 2. Connect & Deposit

1. Connect wallet to Conxian
2. Enter deposit amount
3. Confirm transaction (0.30% fee)
4. Receive vault shares automatically

**That's it!** Your funds are now earning yield automatically.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up a Stacks Wallet

To interact with Conxian, you'll need a Stacks-compatible wallet. Here are a few popular choices:

*   [Hiro Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) (Recommended for desktop)
*   [Xverse Wallet](https://www.xverse.app/) (Excellent for mobile)

Once you've installed your wallet, make sure to:

1.  **Create a new wallet address.**
2.  **Securely back up your seed phrase.** This is crucial for recovering your wallet if you lose access.
3.  **Fund your wallet with STX tokens.** You'll need STX to pay for transaction fees.

### Step 2: Connect to the Conxian Platform

1.  Navigate to the Conxian web application.
2.  Click the "Connect Wallet" button.
3.  Select your wallet from the list and approve the connection.

You are now connected and ready to use the platform!

### Step 3: Swapping Tokens on the DEX

The Conxian DEX allows you to trade one token for another. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Navigate to the "Swap" or "Trade" page.**
2.  **Select the tokens:** Choose the token you want to sell from the top field, and the token you want to buy from the bottom field.
3.  **Enter the amount:** Type in the amount of the token you wish to sell. The interface will automatically calculate the amount of the other token you'll receive.
4.  **Review the details:** Check the exchange rate, any fees, and the potential price impact (slippage).
5.  **Approve and Swap:** You may need to first approve the token for trading, then confirm the swap transaction in your wallet.

### Step 4: Earning Yield with Vaults

Yield vaults are the easiest way to put your crypto to work. You deposit your tokens, and the vault automatically uses DeFi strategies to earn interest for you.

1.  **Navigate to the "Vaults" or "Earn" page.**
2.  **Select a vault:** Choose the vault for the asset you want to deposit (e.g., a STX vault or an sBTC vault).
3.  **Enter the deposit amount:** Specify how much of the token you want to deposit.
4.  **Review the transaction:** The interface will show you an estimate of the "shares" you will receive. These shares represent your portion of the vault's total assets.
5.  **Confirm the deposit:** Approve the transaction in your wallet.

As the vault earns yield, the value of your shares will increase. You can withdraw your assets at any time by reversing the process.
